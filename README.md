# SocketProgramming
Programming the sockets using Python to enable Server-Client Communication

Server.py and Client.py is used to transfer a message( i.e "Socket Programming in Python" in this case) in bytes from Server.py -> Client.py.

Server_obj.py and Client_obj.py is used to transmit an object(i.e array, list ot tuple) in bytes from Server_obj.py -> Client_obj.py. A special python library called pickle is used in transmission of object.
